Is that what we
call it? Complicated?

25
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:00,376
Well, whatever it's called,
it's not working, is it?

26
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,417
Come on, Gina,
you're not looking at the big picture.

27
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:04,737
What's the big picture?

28
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,000
Is it you?
Are you my big picture?

29
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,281
Oh, my God, thank you.

30
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,889
You should get
the fuck over yourself.

31
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:10,681
'Cause you know what
you actually are?

32
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:11,832
A caveman.

33
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,625
- You do resemble a caveman.
- You know what it is?

34
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,449
- And you don't?
- You don't want competition.

35
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,745
Gina, please,
calm down. That's what your problem is.

36
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,536
Me calm down?
Did you just tell me..

37
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:22,777
Don't tell me to fucking
calm down! I'm calm!

38
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:25,657
I've never been
more fucking calm in my life.

39
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,801
"Oh, look at me.

40
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:30,905
I'm English. I'm avoidant.
I don't like to argue."

41
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,409
Well, guess what?

42
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,809
I just want a little peace
in my life. Right?

43
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,513
- It'd be nice.
- I'm from America, bitch. We're gonna fight about it.

44
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,585
Go. Just go. Go.
So what does that make me?

45
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,961
Does that make me stressful?

46
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,656
No, no, no.

47
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,121
A little violent perhaps.

48
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:46,777
I'm a professional.

49
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,665
Yeah. And a little violent.

50
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:49,529
A little bit.

51
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,033
Teeny bit.

52
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,313
You know what it is?

53
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,040
I've got your skills
and then some.

54
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,113
And neither of you like it
because you're both cavemen.

55
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,353
She's talking to you.

56
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,121
Actually, she's looking
in your direction.

57
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,097
- I'm talking to you.
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,313
But about you.

59
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,169
You might be my boss,

60
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,801
but I can tell that you're also
from this planet called "hopeless"

61
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,033
where intimate relationships
and feelings

62
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,049
don't fucking exist!

63
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:16,025
Fucking baby. I've wasted
so much of my life on you.

64
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:18,168
You are a loser.
But I like you.

65
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,369
Thanks.
Why are you here?

66
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:24,888
I lost my ring at this bar,
and I need you to..

67
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:28,185
I'm sorry. Is that it?
Are we done talking?

68
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,329
Are you done
with this conversation?

69
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:31,833
Conversation?

70
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,392
It's more like angry chatter.

71
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,673
Fuck you.

72
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:38,457
She's talking to you again.

73
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:42,297
It's depressing.
No. It's okay.

74
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,704
I liked her, Barney.

75
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,225
She's an Expendable, Christmas.

76
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:59,320
Look, I got great respect for
your uncanny abilities. I really do.

77
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,169
But you are a selfish prick.

78
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,577
Really?
We all are.

79
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,849
We have to be
to choose this life

80
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,545
over friends, over family.

81
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:09,305
We do this for money.

82
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,697
That's the definition of prickism.

83
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,393
What do you think
of my analysis?

84
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,521
Pretty good?

85
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:18,457
I think you're a moron.

86
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:19,705
You don't believe that.

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,137
With every cell in my body.

88
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,312
Why are we here?

89
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:28,057
I lost my ring last night in a bet,
and I'm here to try to buy it back.

90
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,184
Seriously?

91
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,104
Yeah, seriously.

92
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,641
A silly little trinket.

93
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,065
I'm superstitious about it,
and I like it.

94
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,113
Feel like I'm missing a finger.

95
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,457
I tried getting it back,
but this half-ass won't negotiate.

96
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,440
Who?
Jumbo Shrimp.

97
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,913
Who's he?
You'll see.

98
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,537
- What's up, Barney?
- Hey, Billy.

99
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:54,457
So how'd you lose
your most prized possession?

100
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,241
Thumb wrestling.

101
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,417
You mean arm wrestling?
No.

102
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,665
I mean thumb wrestling.

103
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,649
Like that.
Give me your hand.

104
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,345
No. Thumb wrestling?

105
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,552
You used to be strong.
What happened?

106
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,241
And you used to be hairy.
What happened?

107
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,873
Things change.

108
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,385
What's up, Barney?
Hey, how you doing?

109
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:13,753
Jumbo Shrimp around?

110
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,417
Is there a problem?

111
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:18,265
- My friend wants his ring back.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,177
Bet's a bet, man.

113
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,129
You know, no offense,
but I'm missing my ring.

114
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,760
It stays where it is.

115
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:29,881
That's unacceptable.

116
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,833
Striking resemblance.

117
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,353
That's brutal.

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,705
- These the guys, Barney?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,657
Now I see
why they call him Jumbo.

120
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:44,857
- No, the other guy, second guy.
- Oh.

121
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,993
You lost to Santa's helper?

122
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,393
That's embarrassing.

123
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,577
I was drunk.

124
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,593
Well, you're not drunk now.

125
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,033
Why the fuck am I here?

126
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,361
I hurt my back.

127
00:07:58,809 --> 00:07:59,897
Since when?

128
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,977
A few weeks ago.
I can't even lift a fork.

129
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,873
I would do it for you. But if you
don't want to do it, I understand.

130
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:04,953
If you're intimidated...

131
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,265
Intimidated?

132
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:07,705
Hey, Lee.

133
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,593
Make it easy on yourself.

134
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:11,961
The classics.

135
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:13,913
I got this, Thumbo.

136
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,089
Beer, please.

137
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,193
How you doing this nice day?

138
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,561
What do you prefer to be called,
"Jumbo" or "Shrimp"?

139
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:32,345
Call me that again.

140
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,810
Cut your fucking head off.

141
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:38,361
That's a little harsh,
bite-size.

142
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,249
Barney wants his ring back.

143
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:41,561
What did you call me?

144
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,833
How much for it back, Yoda?

145
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,241
Hey!

146
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,097
It stays here, asshole.

147
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,241
My back.

148
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:57,785
You see,

149
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,761
what we have here is a matter of
humiliation and human kindness.

150
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,729
My friend here loves his ring
for all of his stupid reasons.

151
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:06,377
And it would be very nice
and civilized

152
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,793
if you gents would
understand that principle.

153
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,873
But since you choose to be..

154
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,721
Barney, what's the word?
Obstinate.

155
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,849
Too long.

156
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,577
Dumbbells.

157
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,489
Dumbbells.

158
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:22,073
You leave me no other choice,
dinky.

159
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,937
- You're welcome.
- You're slowing down.

160
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,425
My turn, bitch.

161
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:45,113
Come on, chuck.
Come on, cowboy. Bring it.

162
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,681
Get him a beer when he wakes up.

163
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,473
You almost killed me.

164
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,417
I thought you had a bad back.

165
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:05,753
You know, it's a miracle.
It just went away.

166
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:09,113
You know, I really didn't need
this lovefest.

167
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,641
I like spending time with you.

168
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:17,081
Next time,
take me on a pony ride, okay?

169
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,521
Okay.

170
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:40,313
Overwatch, what is the status?

171
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,338
Sir, there are
three soldiers guarding the general.

172
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,457
<font color="#32D838"><i>You're gonna need backup.</i></font>

173
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,665
<font color="#32D838"><i>I repeat, wait for backup.</i></font>

174
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,353
What the fuck is he doing?

175
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,529
No, no, no.
No, no, please. Please, don't.

176
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:25,849
What's up, General?

177
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,889
Are my eyes deceiving me?
Why?

178
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,994
What's that thing
on Gunner's head?

179
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,818
It looks like a sick cat.

180
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,153
Cats are cute.

181
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,457
That looks like tumbleweed.

182
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:49,369
Hey, good evening, big man.

183
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,929
Let's talk. What's that
thing on your head?

184
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,785
Oh, the wig?

185
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,961
Yeah, the wig.
Question is, why?

186
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,049
Well, I was chatting
with this girl on the Internet

187
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,122
and she likes
that '70s look, you know.

188
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
The Farrah Fawcett thing.

189
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,321
Got it. You met her yet?

190
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,297
Why.. Why would I do that?
I like the mystery.

191
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,145
Understand? Yeah,
that makes sense.

192
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,497
Sounds special.
It does.

193
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,289
I liked him better
when he was a drunk.

194
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,698
I know what you mean.
Me too.

195
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,201
I'm happy for you.

196
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,865
Hey, is this the new guy?

197
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,489
Hey, it's Easy Day.

198
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,345
Good man. Ex-special forces.

199
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,649
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey, Easy.

200
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,922
This our sniper?

201
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,505
Don't worry about it.
I got a prescription scope.

202
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,137
What?

203
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:35,865
Well, Hawkeyes,
remember this face.

204
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,369
Don't shoot it by accident.

205
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,314
You don't have to worry
about me.

206
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:41,442
Who's this guy?

207
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,873
You're slipping, pal.

208
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,793
You hired him.
That's Galgo's son.

209
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:47,929
I have the eyesight, the heart
and the sex drive of my father.

210
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,858
Tell me he doesn't talk
as much as his father.

211
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,161
He's worse.
No.

212
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,313
Twice as bad.

213
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,137
It's gonna be a long trip.

214
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,505
I am Galan.

215
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,682
That suppose to mean something?

216
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,745
It's supposed to mean
a little something.

217
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,306
All right,
cut the bullshit. All eyes on me.

218
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,330
Who's the suit?

219
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,218
His name is Marsh.

220
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:10,050
I did a few things with him
before I met you.

221
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,825
He's CIA.
Hey, Barney, how you doing?

222
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,042
How you doing, Marsh?

223
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,353
How they hanging?

224
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,241
Gravity's setting in.

225
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,642
Welcome to the club.

226
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,730
As much as I would like to
exchange pleasantries with you guys,

227
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,610
there's a pressing matter
at hand.

228
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:25,977
Meet Suharato Rahmat.

229
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,217
Former British national
turned arms dealer.

230
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,049
He has his own private army
and he's been hired

231
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:32,410
to steal some detonators
for nuclear missiles

232
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,106
for a very dangerous client.

233
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:37,018
Word on the street is
the client's name is Ocelot.

234
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,617
Hmm.

235
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:40,826
Now, those detonators
get in the hands of Ocelot,

236
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,706
he's planning on using them to
create an international incident.

237
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,658
We can't let that happen.

238
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,825
So that's where
you guys come in.

239
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,153
Your landing zone is Qaddafi's
old chemical war plant in Libya,

240
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,362
which I hear is very nice
this time of year.

241
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,010
Your mission is to make sure
the detonators stay there.

242
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,321
All right?

243
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,018
That's all I got.
Good luck.

244
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,777
Barney, keep 'em tucked.

245
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,281
I'll do my best.

246
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,017
Operation Ocelot.
Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,778
When were you gonna tell me?

248
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,097
When you stopped playing
footsies with your girlfriend.

249
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:20,889
Hey, why's Christmas so pissed
about this Ocelot mission?

250
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,898
He's just being Christmas.

251
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:26,585
- Copy that.
- He knows Barney very well.

252
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:30,041
He knows exactly how far
he's willing to go to end Ocelot.

253
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,281
Who the hell
names himself Ocelot?

254
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,586
Years ago, the CIA hired Barney

255
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:37,913
to find out who code
name "Ocelot" actually is.

256
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,370
He was close when somebody
walked him into an ambush

257
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:43,641
and nearly killed
his entire team.

258
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:45,338
Damn.

259
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,194
Yeah, some would say
Ocelot's a ghost

260
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,681
that Barney created to cover
his own ass for a mistake.

261
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,090
No fucking way.

262
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,513
Ocelot exists and Barney
will bury him someday.

263
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,650
What the fuck happened
to your ear, man?

264
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,666
I'm glad you asked me that.

265
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:04,825
I wrestled in college. Common affliction
in that sport is contusions to the ear.

266
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:08,154
Small pocket of blood that
separates the skin from the cartilage.

267
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,546
Come on, big bird.

268
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,386
Get up there, you deathtrap.

269
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,017
Don't insult it.

270
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:38,489
We have a successful liftoff.

271
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,257
Maybe it was
my first ménage à trois.

272
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:50,905
You know. You know, Toll Road,
what I'm talking about, right?

273
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:53,921
Hey.

274
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,186
You know what is
a golden shower?

275
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,866
It's when the woman, she..

276
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,874
<font color="#32D838"><i>She squats down on top of you
and releases her bladder.</i></font>

277
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,153
<font color="#32D838"><i>It's very liberating.</i></font>

278
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:06,073
Wow, a world-class pervert.

279
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,546
You know what is
a golden shower?

280
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,850
You look like the type
who has had one before.

281
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,578
I'm cutting these losers.

282
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:15,290
I heard too much of that.
It's tune time. Time for music.

283
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:18,969
It's ancient.

284
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,282
It's soothing.

285
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,817
Soothing?
Yeah.

286
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,513
Yeah, maybe.

287
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:26,554
You know I had
a panic attack last night.

288
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,018
Did you really?
Are you sure? Yeah.

289
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,425
Like your skin starts to crawl?

290
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,377
Your heart is beating?
You know it.

291
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:34,906
Just take some Xanax and
pretend you're happy with your life.

292
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,378
I am happy.

293
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,578
By the way,
you're the worst doctor, ever.

294
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,713
Maybe it's Gina
who's making you anxious.

295
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,761
She actually relaxes me.

296
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,034
It's this.. This.. The job.

297
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:48,569
No.

298
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,537
Some guys are just not meant
for companionship.

299
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:52,441
Face the facts.
Wrong.

300
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,193
Maybe you want to die a bitter old sod,
but not me.

301
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,370
I want to be cheerful, happy.

302
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:01,113
But I will come visit you
in the home.

303
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,354
- Promise?
- Scout's honor.

304
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:07,162
Let's see what's going on.

305
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,545
<font color="#32D838"><i>One of them was
covering me in hot candle wax.</i></font>

306
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,689
Forget it.

307
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,113
Where are the detonators?

308
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,458
Never!

309
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:19,961
Your wife.

310
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,201
Not my wife.
No, <font color="#32D838"><i>Allahu Akbar.</i></font>

311
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,761
Your son is next.

312
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,322
P-Please, not my son.
Please.

313
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,370
Give me the detonators,
and I'll make it quick.

314
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:30,681
My son, Adam...

315
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,473
This is a fact
you cannot change.

316
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,425
Give me the detonators or...

317
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,641
Not my son.

318
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,794
Your choice.

319
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,106
Okay. Okay.

320
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:40,185
They are in control room.

321
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:42,201
The code to the safe is...

322
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:44,890
eight,

323
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,105
one,

324
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,233
four,

325
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,290
two...

326
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,106
seven.

327
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,897
Wise choice.

328
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,769
Let's wake up the kids.

329
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:57,753

Yep.

Where'd that come from?

333
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,186
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

Got it.

339
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:37,849
Touch and go.

340
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:39,386
Okay, rally up. Rally up.

341
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,793
Am I driving lead?
Nah.

342
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,649
Take Gunner to over watch
and fall in.

343
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,225
Touch!

344
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,490
Happy hunting.

345
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,713
Check it out. There's something
happening at the weapons plant.

346
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:07,930
We're on it.

349
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,042
Sir, I have a new transport.

350
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,170
Excellent.

351
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,306
Tell Ocelot we have them.

352
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,106
Let's go.

353
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,058
In position.

354
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,265

Gunner, you got eyes on them?

357
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,386
Like crystal in headlights.

358
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:51,034
Gunner, you're way off target.

359
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,522
What do you need,
a seeing-eye dog?

360
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,521
Damn spots.

361

369
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,562
Kill them.

370
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,186
Open fire!

371
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,058
Gunner, we could use some help!

372
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,498
Six months sober.

373
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,450
Now that's
what I'm talking about, Gunner.

374
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:03,162
Can you lose them?

375
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:14,458
- We're inside!
- Copy.

376
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,073
Split up.

377
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:20,186
Galan, we'll take point.

378
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,937
- You go after that squirter.
- Copy.

379
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:34,170
Ooh.

380
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,858
We lost the .50 cal.

381
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:51,866
Pull up alongside him.

382
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,394
Time to improvise.

383
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,730
I can improvise.

384
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,865
Gut shot. You'll live.

385
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,290
Whoa.

386
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,634
Maybe not.

387
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,322
Galan,
what the fuck are you doing?

388
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,890
I'm improvising.

389
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:47,002
What's going on in there?
I need a status report now!

390
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,161
One more and we're on Rahmat.

391
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:06,042
What the fuck, Easy?

392
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,810
Only easy day was yesterday.

393
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:11,938
Yep.

394
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:18,490
Initial success
or total failure?

395
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:28,538
Initial success.

396
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,194
I'm out of ammo.
I'm coming in.

397
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,770
You mean total failure.

398
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:48,570
Christmas, where are you?
The detonators are compromised.

400
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,098
Don't let Rahmat leave
with those detonators

401
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,562
or there's gonna be
a lot of dead people.

405
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:11,354
Moving!

406
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,194
Cover me!

Don't worry, my friend.
I would never leave you behind.

Nice work, man,
but who's on Rahmat?

419
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:51,578
Holy shit.

What is this, a bad joke?

454
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,442
Well, you disobeyed a
direct order from your superior

455
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,674
and that cost us the mission,
so you're out.

- I was trying to save him.
- Well, you didn't.

It's our play, it's our call.
You're out.

It was Barney's
sacrifice to make, brother.

459
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:23,194
Good death for the mission,
it would count.

460
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:24,986
And you just took it from him.

461
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,674
Made his sacrifice worthless.

462
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:35,067

Oh.

467
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:06,266
Barney hated cover bands.

468

I'm gonna go get a drink.

480
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,426
We're about to go live.

481
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:12,187
We're about to stream this shit,

482
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:15,322
and you girls look like shit.

483
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,755
Uh, no. No.

484
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,611
Buh-bye.

485
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:23,034
Hey,
muscles. Get over here.

486
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:30,554
Here, dude.
Hold my sign.

487
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,498
Whoo!

488
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,538
I'm your
private security detail.

489
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,298
I'm here to protect you.

490
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:39,898
Not hold your sign.

491
00:31:40,987 --> 00:31:44,089
You see anybody
looking to do me harm?

492
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:46,138
Potentially.

493
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,826
Whatever.
Just hold the sign.

494
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:51,769
"Potentially."
Double-O douche bag.

495
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,203
What's up, motherfuckers?

496
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,282
I'm here at my NOLA pad

497
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,266
live streaming to you at home.

498
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:03,834
Bringing a little

499
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:06,202
into your pathetic little lives.

500
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,314
Look at these NOLA bitches.

501
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:13,307
Which one.. No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?

502
00:32:13,435 --> 00:32:16,283
Oi. Have
some respect for the ladies.

503
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,203
I am live streaming here.

504
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:20,569
You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.

505
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,939
Who does this motherfucker
think he is?

506
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,211
"Oi, respect the ladies."

507
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,099
I'll respect them all right.

508
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:29,282
Respect them enough to let
them lick the sweat off my balls.

509
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,210
Fuck, dude, my nose.

510
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:38,042
Do you know how much money
I make off this face, asshole?

511
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:06,522
Fuck it.

512
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:11,547
Welcome home, love.

513
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:13,914
You're lucky I didn't shoot you.

514
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:17,275
Probably.

515
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:19,131
Hey, do you read now?

516
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:20,923
What is this?

517
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,803
Going somewhere, are we?

518
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:26,362
We're going after the guy
that got Barney.

519
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:32,346
The only good thing that came out of Barney's
death was the unsealing of that file.

520
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:34,969
What the fuck does that
mean? What's in here?

521
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:37,050
Well,

522
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,099
Barney was part of
a classified operation

523
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,243
in between
international agencies.

524
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:45,339
And when it went south, all the parties
involved decided to seal the file

525
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:48,091
until everyone
associated with it was dead.

526
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,354
So once Barney passed,
that file was declassified.

527
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:54,395
It gave us a vital clue
on Ocelot's identity.

528
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:59,643
I want in.
I'm coming with you.

529
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:01,115
Oh, I'm sorry.

530
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,834
You weren't invited.

531
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:05,115
Oh.

532
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:07,482
Well, won't you be lonely
without me?

533
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:09,562
No.

534
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,643
There's lots of other boys
on the mission.

535
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:12,771
Oh.

536
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:16,571
I'm not in the mood.

537
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,971
I'm gonna play a little Hendrix.

538
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:21,211
Usually does the trick.
Don't start.

539
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,259
Oh, I'm starting.

540
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,794
Oh, I always liked this tattoo.

541
00:35:28,923 --> 00:35:30,746
So did your brother.

542
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:40,443
This was always my favorite seat
in the house.

543
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,129
Well, these and the cheap seats.

544
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:52,411
You really need to
be more careful. Mmm.

545
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:53,786
Make me.

546
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:02,362
Do an old soldier a favor.

547
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:06,074
First things first.

548
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,619
When I first met Barney...

549
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,169
I was straight out of the SAS.

550
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:34,395
Nothing to my name,
down on my luck.

551
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:42,267
He took a chance on me
when no one else would.

552
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:49,402
We're gonna get the guy
that did this to Barney.

553
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,242
I promise.

554
00:36:58,203 --> 00:37:00,315
I know I can't go with you.

555
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,859
But I want you to take this.

556
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:13,827
Well,

557
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,178
I'll make sure
to give Rahmat your regards.

558
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,739
You catch any of that?

559
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,787
I don't know what she's saying.

560
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:04,603
- But why do you think they call her Lash?
- I have no idea.

561
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:07,707
But I'd love to find out.
She can lash me anytime.

562
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,906
Oh, it's way bigger
than that, darling.

563
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:12,635
No, no.
That's the Chinese bird.

564
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,035
- We use the middle finger, they use the pinky.
- Oh.

565
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:17,946
But if the shoe fits...

566
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,283
I was saying
what's up with your ears?

567
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,755
- My ear?
- Oh, shit.

568
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,995
Well, everybody knows
I wrestled in college.

569
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:27,579
And a common affliction in that sport
is that you get a contusion in the ear

570
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,971
that separates the cartilage from
the skin and creates a little pocket.

571
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,731
I've had this one
drained nine times.

572
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:34,459
I've never seen him so quiet.

573
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:36,443
In essence, God gave me armor.

574
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,195
He hasn't said
anything since Barney died.

575
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:42,203
Now, I caught my
roommate talking shit about it one time.

576
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:45,499
And I had to smack him upside his head
and give him his own cauliflower ear.

577
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:46,811
That's just the way it goes.

578
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:49,403
You want to feel it? No?

579
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:51,259
It's not contagious.
I promise.

588
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,683
Ex-Task Force 90.
Thailand Special Forces.

589
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,179
Supposedly owns a boat
that docks around here.

590
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,955
Don't know anyone around here
like that.

591
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,195
But if he have boat,

592
00:39:51,963 --> 00:39:55,131
boat down there, not up here.

593
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,875
Thanks for your help.

594
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,531
Hey, excuse me, friend.

595
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,091
You know the owner of this boat?

596
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:43,675
I'm looking
for a man named Decha.

597
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:47,995
I'm sorry.
Decha has long gone.

598
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:49,915
Oh, yeah? Where?

599
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:54,139
To a place of peace.

600
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:55,715
Dead?

601
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:57,507
Ah.

602
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,467
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of that going around.

603
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,139
Excuse me.

604
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:08,987
I can't let you
steal this boat, Sir.

605
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,419
What's it to you?

606
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,163
Just a boat.

607
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,339
It's not yours.

608
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:23,803
Hey, listen, I'm taking this boat
with or without your permission.

609
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,939
Why do you have Barney's ring?

610
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,627
Barney's dead.

611
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:38,075
And I need this boat to get
to the people who killed him.

612
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:39,995
I was looking for Decha.

613
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,067
From what Barney said about the man,
I could use him for what's ahead.

614
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:44,635
Barney's dead.

615
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:50,747
I was once Decha,
the man you seek.

616
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,243
But I put that man behind me.

617
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:55,452
If what you say is true,

618
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,043
Barney should have his revenge.

619
00:41:58,171 --> 00:41:59,835
Damn right, he should.

620
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,171
Hey.

621
00:42:17,595 --> 00:42:19,163
Okay, listen up.

622
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:22,875
The Thai cargo ship <font color="#32D838"><i>Jintara</i></font>
was hijacked

623
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:25,307
in the Andaman Sea
by our mutual friend Rahmat.

624
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:27,132
The <font color="#32D838"><i>Jintara</i></font> has changed course

625
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:30,619
and is tracking en route to the
Russian coast of Vladivostok.

626
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:33,531
Now, due to that royal
cluster fuck that was Libya,

627
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:36,411
Rahmat has taken possession
of the nuclear detonators.

628
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:38,524
The ship itself
is gonna be hosting an exchange

629
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:41,563
where they'll be taking possession
of the remaining nuclear materials

630
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,995
needed to construct
a viable bomb, nuclear type.

631
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:46,619
And we cannot let that happen.
Understood?

632
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:48,795
Now,
we also have valuable intel that says

633
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,132
that Ocelot will be
on the <font color="#32D838"><i>Jintara.</i></font>

634
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,099
So this might be our one and only
chance to learn of his true identity.

635
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:57,115
- Or her.
- What's that?

636
00:42:57,852 --> 00:42:59,099
Could be a her.

637
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:01,915
Or her identity, yes.

638
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:03,484
And bring him or her in.

639
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:05,915
As you know, Barney's death
opened up a file

640
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,412
that reveals the name of a
man who worked with Ocelot.

641
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:10,395
A witness in witness protection.

642
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:12,315
More on him from Russo.

643
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:14,907
Name's Phen Lyong Bai.

644
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:18,075
Ocelot's former partner
who'd love to rat Ocelot out.

645
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:19,619
Snitches get stitches.
Right, Gunner?

646
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:21,435
That's right.
Snitches get stitches.

647
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:24,123
I don't have to tell you
how sensitive this mission is.

648
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:28,763
If the Russians get wind that
the US forces are not only near

649
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,492
but inside Russian territory,

650
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,316
it's a World War III shit show.

651
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,300
Understood?

652
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:36,419
So that's why this mission carries
no US signature whatsoever.

653
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:38,012
Full deniability.

654
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,347
If this goes bad, it's on you.
And one last thing.

655
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:43,963
Since you Neanderthals dicked up
that last mission in Libya without me,

656
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,291
I'm gonna be coming along
to babysit you this time.

657
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,106
Now, won't that be fun?
Gina.

658
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:53,563
All right, so the mission's
gonna go down like this.

659
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,147
We're gonna run this assault as a
split team with two separate objectives.

660
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:58,490
We're gonna HALO in.

661
00:43:58,619 --> 00:43:59,939
Team Alpha's
gonna secure the bridge

662
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:01,755
while Bravo searches
and sweeps the boat.

663
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:04,379
We're gonna identify,
kill-capture both Ocelot and Rahmat,

664
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:08,346
secure the detonators and the
nuclear components, helo extract.

665
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:09,947
Any questions?

666
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:15,452
Is my delivery a little
different than Barney's?

667
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,043
He probably would have just said,
"Let's go."

668
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:19,228
Yeah.

669
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,570
Well...

670
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,427
let's go.

671
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:31,067
Is that an axe?

672
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:33,531
No, it's a snow shovel.

673
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:37,915
That makes sense. Not for humanity,
but for you it makes sense.

674
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,819
Hey. So what's your story?

675
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:49,851
Barney told me
you were ex-Task Force 90.

676
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,643
Ultimate killer type.

677
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:54,203
Never seen anyone faster
or better.

678
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:59,995
There's only so many times
you can kill a man, Christmas.

679
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,299
Each time,

680
00:45:02,428 --> 00:45:04,251
it gets easier.

681
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:09,659
You become numb to pain,
to joy, and to love.

682
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,563
With every person you kill,

683
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:17,083
you lose
a little more of yourself.

684
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,628
I had to stop
before there was nothing left.

685
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:40,635
Figured I'd be
using my axe by now.

686
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,450
This is too quiet.
Something ain't right.

687
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,483
Easy Day, Lash, you're with me. The
rest of you, swing around port quarter.

688
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,628
Where's port quarter again?

689
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:57,147
I was Army. We said left and right,
not port and starship shit.

690
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,939
Starboard is right.

691
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:01,755
Port, left. Quarter, back.

692
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:03,388
Got it. Let's move.

693
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,084
Got a bad feeling about this.

694
00:47:37,212 --> 00:47:39,387
Yeah,
where the hell is everybody?

695
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:41,692
The nuke is definitely
on board.

696
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:45,852
<font color="#32D838"><i>All right, listen up.
Bad news.</i></font>

697
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:48,348
<font color="#32D838"><i>They already have uranium
with the detonators.</i></font>

698
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:52,091
<font color="#32D838"><i>There is now an active
nuclear bomb on the ship.</i></font>

699
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,132
We're about to take the bridge.

700
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:07,644
It's a ghost town in here.

701
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:10,299
Go!
Put your weapons down now!

702
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,979
What a fucking mess
this turned out to be.

703
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:19,931
First Libya, now this.

704
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,139
Somebody knew we were coming.
Both times.

705
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:23,579
My intel was solid.

706
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:25,435
- Your intel was shit.
- Ah, shit on this.

707
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:26,908
The intel
could have been leaked.

708
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:29,307
- We don't know you.
- He was verified.

709
00:48:29,435 --> 00:48:31,386
Well, then maybe it was
your new girlfriend.

710
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:32,923
Fuck you, Gunner.

711
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,612
You sold us out in Vilena
on that mission.

712
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,468
Think I'd forget about that?

713
00:48:37,596 --> 00:48:39,643
Somebody did sell us out.

714
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,468
How about your man?

715
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:43,610
You sold him out
so you could be on top.

716
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,372
Back off.
She wouldn't do that.

717
00:48:45,499 --> 00:48:47,292
What? Fuck him on top?

718
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:48,666
Fuck you.

719
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,363
Maybe it's the mute
over in the corner.

720
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:52,988
What's up, Galan?
Cat got your tongue, cowboy?

721
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:55,420
Yeah,
he's hiding something. Yeah.

722
00:48:55,548 --> 00:48:58,107
I never trusted this fucking guy.

723
00:49:09,148 --> 00:49:11,547
- Who's the leader?
- I'm the leader.

724
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,483
Take him.

725
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:50,075
Fuck.

726
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,827
There she is.

727
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,763
Go time.

728
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,844
I'll go first.

729
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:04,804
Send down a signal when
it's clear for you to follow.

730
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:06,524
This is as far as I go.

731
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:10,203
- I could use you.
- I can't.

732
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:13,116
If I let the old me out,

733
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:16,795
I don't know if I could ever
get him back in.

734
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:23,419
I understand.

735
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,628
Should be carnage up here.

736
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,027
Where are you guys?

737
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:27,964
My shift's done.
Going downstairs.

738
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:45,947
Don't move and turn around.

739
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:47,227
Slowly.

740
00:51:47,356 --> 00:51:48,890
Well, which one is it, friend?

741
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,867
Don't move
or turn around slowly?

742
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:53,980
Turn around.

743
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:55,108
Very slowly.

744
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:01,852
Ah! Jesus Christ!

745
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,764
Colin, you scared the shit out of me,
you bell end.

746
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,684
Colin?
Who the fuck is Colin?

747
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:09,979
Don't give me that. Hey,
you need to be careful with that.

748
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:12,220
That could go off in your hand.

749
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,939
Perfect timing,
Mr. Marsh.

750

<font color="#32D838"><i>Marsh?</i></font>

751
00:52:31,868 --> 00:52:33,532
This mission was a trap.

752
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,420
Somebody leaked our intel.

757
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:50,019
If not,

758
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:54,139
Mr. Marsh will be the example
of how deadly serious I am.

759
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:57,307
So, what's it going to be,
Russo?

760
00:52:57,436 --> 00:52:59,835
I don't have the authority.

761
00:52:59,963 --> 00:53:01,404
I know you don't!

762
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:05,212
But I know someone who does.

763
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:19,356
Let's get the last

<font color="#32D838"><i>the sweat off my balls.</i></font>

786
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:47,803
Huh.
This doesn't belong to you.

787
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,060
Where are my friends?

788
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,340
Where are my friends?
Mm-mmm.

789
00:55:57,468 --> 00:55:59,228
Sir, we might have a problem.

790
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,660
Paithoon and Takk
have gone dark.

791
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:06,236
Room 657, B-deck.

792
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:07,995
Much appreciated.

793
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:10,436
Ah.

794
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:14,332
Gunner.

795
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,924
<font color="#32D838"><i>Takk?</i></font>
Don't mind if I do.

796
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:20,444
<font color="#32D838"><i>Report back, Takk.
We may have a rat on board.</i></font>

797
00:56:20,571 --> 00:56:22,652
<font color="#32D838"><i>Check everyone's status.</i></font>

798
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,796
<font color="#32D838"><i>Takk?</i></font>

799
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,876
Takk can't come
to the phone right now.

800
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:29,500
He's a little limp.

801
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,076
Who is this?

802
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:36,891
<font color="#32D838"><i>A man who made a mistake
letting you live.</i></font>

803
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,804
- But I'm here to remedy that.
- <font color="#32D838"><i>Ah.</i></font>

804
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:42,524
Look who's still
trying to be a hero.

805
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:44,796
<font color="#32D838"><i>How nice of you to come aboard.</i></font>

806
00:56:44,924 --> 00:56:48,284
<font color="#32D838"><i>If you're hoping for a redo of the mess
in Libya, you're too late, I'm afraid.</i></font>

807
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,268
My men are on their way
to hunt you down.

808
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:54,332
<font color="#32D838"><i>So I guess it's up to me
to put you in an early grave.</i></font>

809
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,884
Just like I did your friend
in Libya.

810
00:56:59,227 --> 00:57:01,468
Correction.
He wasn't my friend.

811
00:57:02,012 --> 00:57:03,419
He was my brother.

812
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:04,987
So you can bring your army.

813
00:57:05,116 --> 00:57:06,972
<font color="#32D838"><i>Bring all the fucking men

814

<font color="#32D838"><i>and I'll work through

815
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:10,460
<font color="#32D838"><i>When I get to you,</i></font>

816
00:57:10,588 --> 00:57:12,628
I'll make sure that the
only way you leave this ship

817
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:15,452
is in a wonderful variety
of pieces.

818
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:58,076
Don't shoot by the bomb!

819
00:59:01,948 --> 00:59:04,379
Pavel, you have eyes on the rat?

820
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:06,844
<font color="#32D838"><i>Yes, Sir.</i></font> Location?

821
00:59:06,972 --> 00:59:08,636
<font color="#32D838"><i>Corridor, deck one.</i></font>

822
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:15,836
<font color="#32D838"><i>Deck two.</i></font>
What?

823
00:59:31,036 --> 00:59:33,435
<font color="#32D838"><i>Officers' dining area,
deck three.</i></font>

824
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:11,900
Rubber side down, mate.

825
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,477
He's on the stern.

826
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:14,940
What are you doing?

827
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:16,924
Thought you were done
with this life.

828
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:20,860
It would be disrespectful to
Barney's memory to let his friend die.

829
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,261
I like the look.

830
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:24,572
Thank you.

831
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,228
- Then let's get to it.
- Okay.

832
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,476
Everything's sealed tight
down here.

833
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:54,308
Yeah,
these are welded up solid too.

834
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,484
Okay, so what's next?

835
01:02:55,613 --> 01:02:57,020
Bilge system.

836
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,940
What?
Bilge system.

837
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:02,429
In emergencies, it clears
water from the ship's dry areas.

838
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:04,477
If you get it open,
it should let us out of here.

839
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:07,036
Come on,
man. Let's get this fucking thing open.

840
01:03:07,164 --> 01:03:09,021
Damn it.

841
01:03:11,293 --> 01:03:14,045
- Well, that ain't budging.
- No shit. It's got to get wet.

842
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:15,420
What?

843
01:03:15,547 --> 01:03:17,404
Wet. If it gets wet,
it'll open.

844
01:03:18,492 --> 01:03:21,340
- Well, anybody gotta pee?
- I gotta go.

845
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:24,477
I've had to piss
since we HALO'd in here.

846
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,747
A little privacy, please?

847
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,564
The hyoid bone.

848
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:50,557
It's the only bone in the human
body not connected to any others.

849
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:54,940
It's right here in the throat.
Without it, we cannot speak.

850
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:57,981
With these hands,
I will claw the hyoid bone

851
01:03:58,109 --> 01:03:59,901
from the throat
of that fucker Rahmat,

852
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:01,596
stick it up
his boyfriend's <font color="#32D838"><i>culo,</i></font>

853
01:04:01,725 --> 01:04:03,420
then make both
of their asses apologize

854
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,724
while they drown
in their own blood.

855
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:07,869
Barney was my hero.

856
01:04:07,995 --> 01:04:09,757
I do not speak, I cannot speak,

857
01:04:09,884 --> 01:04:14,044
because my mind is full of these brutal,
visceral fantasies,

858
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:17,980
fantasies that will now
become a hellish reality.

859
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,004
You should go back
to not talking.

860
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,853
- Done.
- Any takers?

861
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,116
This will lead us to the
men who killed Barney?

862
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:39,324
Uh, yes.

863
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:40,796
I will avenge him.

864
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:49,371
Guess he does
like golden showers.

865
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,764
Lyong Bai is en route to you
as we speak.

866
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:56,733
<font color="#32D838"><i>I expect to have my team
returned alive.</i></font>

867
01:04:56,861 --> 01:04:59,421
Of course. For what is
a man without his word?

868
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:02,141
Prepare for exchange.

869
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:03,708
Moving out!

870
01:05:04,892 --> 01:05:06,973
- This way.
- Okay.

871
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:09,404
Your friends will be really
happy to see you, right?

872
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,813
Probably not.

873
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,020
Gina will have to admit
she needs me.

874
01:05:13,149 --> 01:05:14,149
On three.
Yeah.

875
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:15,420
Three.

876
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,789
Nobody here.

877
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,124
No shit.

878
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:21,437
Where did they go?

879
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:25,277
You smell piss?

880
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:27,067
Yeah.

881
01:05:27,197 --> 01:05:31,804
We're gonna stay quiet
until it's time to get loud.

882
01:05:32,444 --> 01:05:33,724
Okay, okay. Yeah.

883
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,291
Get on the ground!

884
01:05:40,348 --> 01:05:41,724
Time to get loud?

885
01:05:44,924 --> 01:05:47,484
It's you who needs to get
down on the ground, pal.

886
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:49,341
Or what?

887
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:55,548
Or get wasted by an Expendable.

888
01:05:56,796 --> 01:05:59,100
Don't tell me.
You're happy to see me.

889
01:05:59,229 --> 01:06:02,300
Technically, you're not an
Expendable anymore, Christmas.

890
01:06:02,428 --> 01:06:03,837
Especially you.

891
01:06:03,965 --> 01:06:05,981
Such a pleasure.
Likewise.

892
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:07,581
Great timing.
Easy Day.

893
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:09,084
<font color="#32D838"><i>Feliz Navidad.</i></font>

894
01:06:11,517 --> 01:06:12,540
Is that my Traumahawk?

895
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,141
Yeah.
How do you like it?

896
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:16,125
Growing on me.
What took you so long?

897
01:06:16,253 --> 01:06:18,684
Did you think
that I was gonna believe

898
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,957
you were actually
just gifting me your knife?

899
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,069
You gifted her your knife?

900
01:06:23,197 --> 01:06:24,701
And they say romance is dead.

901
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,677
He put a tracker in it.
It was all part of the plan.

902
01:06:27,804 --> 01:06:30,236
Sorry.

903
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:32,700
I feel a little used.

904
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:40,957
Okay, let's go.

905
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:43,069
Hey, Gunner, watch our six.

906
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:44,668
I like your hair.

907
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:46,364
- Who's your new friend?
- Decha.

908
01:06:46,491 --> 01:06:49,149
Old friend of Barney's. Kicks
ass with the best of them.

909
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:51,164
Any friend of Barney's
is all right by me.

910
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:54,140
Rahmat took Marsh.
Huh. I'm devastated.

911
01:06:54,268 --> 01:06:58,589
First things first. Toll Road,
I need you to take a look at something.

912
01:07:00,764 --> 01:07:02,908
It's a big fucking bomb.

913
01:07:03,037 --> 01:07:05,085
With the detonators
that we didn't get.

914
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:07,005
We're fucked.

915
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:08,508
Can you elaborate?

916
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:10,460
This thing's wired
to go in 27 minutes.

917
01:07:10,588 --> 01:07:12,733
It's tamper proof.
Got mercury switches.

918
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:16,093
The only way we're shutting this bad boy
down is to find the remote kill switch.

919
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,381
That's the last line of defense.

920
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:18,973
Now, it's short range,

921
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,501
so whoever has that on their
person is on this fucking boat.

922
01:07:21,629 --> 01:07:22,875
- Rahmat.
- Rahmat.

923
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:24,924
Who's Rahmat?

924
01:07:25,053 --> 01:07:26,557
Guy who killed Barney.

925
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:29,021
We probably
just entered Russian waters.

926
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:31,293
Dressing this ship to look like
a US aircraft carrier

927
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:33,949
with a primed nuke about to
blow off the coast of Russia.

928
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:35,708
It's going
to start World War III.

929
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:38,235
Clock is ticking.
Let's lock and load.

930
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:40,348
New location, deck side.

931
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,845
It's all about
this kill switch now.

932
01:07:42,973 --> 01:07:45,245
Switch off Rahmat permanently.

933
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:48,221
Well, can you make us
something loud and messy?

934
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:50,397
Does the pope shit in the woods?

935
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,380
No, the pope don't shit
in the woods.

936
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:55,069
Or next to a bear. Why
you gotta say shit like that?

937

01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:15,357
Shit!

949
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:41,597
Fuck it!

950
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,845
You're welcome.
Huh.

951
01:09:53,692 --> 01:09:54,845
Don't mention it.

952
01:10:04,637 --> 01:10:05,637
Good to be back.

953
01:10:09,693 --> 01:10:10,844
I got you.

954
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,053
Thanks.

955
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,085
Hey, <font color="#32D838"><i>puta.</i></font>

956
01:10:49,372 --> 01:10:50,557
I got him.

957
01:11:07,357 --> 01:11:08,509
Toll Road!

958
01:11:08,637 --> 01:11:11,452
Easy! Man down! Man down!

959
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:18,461
Can you kiss that
and make it better?

960
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:21,245
Maybe later.
I'm a little busy right now.

961
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,037
I got him.

962
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:31,260
Hey!

963
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:06,461

965
01:12:08,445 --> 01:12:10,077

<font color="#32D838"><i>Proceed as planned.</i></font>

967
01:12:32,956 --> 01:12:34,493
How you doing, Rahmat?

968
01:12:35,677 --> 01:12:38,557
I see you like to play with knives.
Well, I ain't playing no more.

969
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:41,629
You're gonna give me the kill switch,
and we're gonna end all this.

970
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,581
Come and get it, hero.

971
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:54,973
Is that the biggest one
you've got?

972
01:14:21,245 --> 01:14:22,245
Nah.

973
01:14:22,877 --> 01:14:24,190
That's the biggest one I got.

974
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:31,996
Lee, you good?

975
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,308
Yeah.

976
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,061
Where's the kill switch?

977
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:43,516
You fucking idiot.
I don't have the kill switch.

978
01:14:44,637 --> 01:14:46,206
My boss has it.

979
01:14:47,805 --> 01:14:50,236
Ocelot.

980
01:15:07,229 --> 01:15:08,669
Phen Lyong Bai is here.

981
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:11,485
He's our witness
that can identify Ocelot.

982
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:21,726
- Hello, Bai.
- Oh, my God, no.

983
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:23,389
No!
Bye-bye, Bai.

984
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:32,350
Marsh is Ocelot.

985
01:15:32,476 --> 01:15:33,981
He's had the kill switch
this whole..

986
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:38,365
That's for Barney.

987
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:47,484
How long until detonation?

988
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:49,061
Twelve minutes.

989
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:50,749
All right, we got 12 minutes

990
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:52,893
before this ship blows up
like a Roman candl..

991
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:06,109
Hey, Marsh. I guess you
won't be needing that anymore.

992
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:07,965
All right, Christmas!

993
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:09,821
You're like genital warts!

994
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:13,725
Always showing up where you're
not wanted and refusing to go away!

995
01:16:13,852 --> 01:16:15,997
You got something I need, Marsh.

996
01:16:16,893 --> 01:16:18,398
I'm coming down to get it.

997
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:21,725
I guess you figured out
that this device right here

998
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:24,061
is the only thing
preventing World War III,

999
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,292
a conflict that,
while devastating for many,

1000
01:16:27,934 --> 01:16:28,934
it'll be insanely,

1001
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:30,269
insanely,

1002
01:16:30,397 --> 01:16:32,830
insanely profitable
for somebody.

1003
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:35,005
And that somebody
is gonna be me.

1004
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:38,397
And the Expendables
will take all the blame!

1005
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:40,318
So, enjoy the show!

1006
01:16:43,581 --> 01:16:45,150
Kill them all!

1007
01:16:45,278 --> 01:16:46,396
Take cover!

1008
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,397
Everybody get down!

1009
01:16:53,918 --> 01:16:56,324
We need to get clear of this
boat or we're all gonna get fried!

1010
01:16:56,348 --> 01:16:58,534
Jumping overboard is seeming
like a decent plan right now.

1011
01:16:58,558 --> 01:17:01,949
We'll never make it out of the blast
zone. We'll never make it in time.

1012
01:17:05,278 --> 01:17:08,158
Hey, man,
you're not going down on my watch.

1013
01:17:09,565 --> 01:17:11,677
We gotta move.
He's bleeding out.

1014
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:13,725
I got an idea.

1015
01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:16,861
We can take my boat.
It's being towed.

1016
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:18,237
That's a great idea.

1017
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:19,710
Next time,
let's start with that!

1018
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:21,373
Yeah!

1019
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,013
Gunner, give us cover fire.
We're on the way out.

1020
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:25,148
Copy that. Cover
fire.

1021
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:33,118
Meet at the stern.
Repeat, meet at the stern.

1022
01:17:38,941 --> 01:17:41,309
We gotta move!

1023
01:17:42,974 --> 01:17:45,052
I saw them go
to the other side.

1024
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,934
There's no one on the bridge.
Start searching the ship.

1025
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,421
Toll Road, you're next.

1026
01:18:25,086 --> 01:18:26,749
Galan, you're up.

1027
01:18:43,102 --> 01:18:44,102
What?

1028
01:18:46,974 --> 01:18:47,974
Never mind.

1029
01:18:48,509 --> 01:18:50,685
Let's go.

1030
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:08,965
Mission first!

1031
01:19:15,196 --> 01:19:17,212
I gotta turn this ship around.

1032
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,165
Make my sacrifice count!

1033
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:27,068
It's his decision to make.

1034
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:36,477
Decha, we need to move or
Toll Road's not gonna make it.

1035
01:19:47,197 --> 01:19:49,342
Check in block-D
then go around.

1036
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,934
Get the rest of
the inflatable boats up here.

1037
01:21:32,062 --> 01:21:33,886
Sir,
we're headed back out to sea.

1038
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:36,445
Move it,
move it, move it, people!

1039
01:21:41,694 --> 01:21:43,357
Genital fucking warts.

1040
01:21:43,486 --> 01:21:44,574
Take him out!

1041
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:47,390
Get that RIB inflated!

1042
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,397
We need to get the ship
back on course.

1043
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:53,054
Get up to the bridge
and fix this.

1044
01:21:53,182 --> 01:21:54,182
But, Sir...

1045
01:21:55,038 --> 01:21:56,125
But, Sir, what?

1046
01:21:56,254 --> 01:21:57,918
The nuke is gonna blow.
We can't go up..

1047
01:22:01,276 --> 01:22:03,229
How do you feel
about a promotion?

1048
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:05,277
All to the bridge!

1049
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:08,670
Take him down!
All to the bridge! Go, go!

1050
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:08,829
Looks like I'll be
seeing you soon, Barney.

1051
01:23:32,476 --> 01:23:33,661
Christmas!

1052
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,741
Right here, Marsh.

1053
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:47,229
Ho ho ho! I see you
called in the cavalry!

1054
01:23:47,901 --> 01:23:49,630
Well, you can't get rid of me.

1055
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:51,869
Well, the fun's in trying.

1056
01:23:51,998 --> 01:23:54,270
Why don't you come down
face-to-face?

1057
01:23:54,398 --> 01:23:56,158
Man-to-man.

1058
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:58,461
Huh.

1059
01:23:58,589 --> 01:24:00,126
Old school.

1060
01:24:00,254 --> 01:24:01,533
Don't mind if I do.

1061
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:03,678
Can't wait.

1062
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:06,141
Don't you fucking move!
I'll be right down.

1063
01:24:07,965 --> 01:24:12,318
Barney tried to expose me 25 years ago,
and he failed.

1064
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:15,294
But you, you're a good soldier.

1065
01:24:15,902 --> 01:24:17,278
You're a very good soldier.

1066
01:24:17,406 --> 01:24:20,414
But this, I mean,
this is above and beyond.

1067
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:23,070
This..
This is next level.

1068
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,558
Barney would be proud of you.

1069
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,854
Well, you can tell him yourself.

1070
01:24:30,494 --> 01:24:32,092
Because you're
about to join him.

1071
01:24:32,222 --> 01:24:34,334
So very nice.

1072
01:24:34,462 --> 01:24:36,286
Look what Santa brought me.

1073
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:49,276
The fuck?

1074
01:24:49,405 --> 01:24:50,462
Barney?

1075
01:24:50,589 --> 01:24:53,054
Hey, I had him
with the classics!

1076
01:24:53,181 --> 01:24:55,614
You almost fucking killed me!

1077
01:24:55,741 --> 01:24:57,246
You're welcome.

1078
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:01,445
Come on!

1079
01:25:02,942 --> 01:25:04,285
The fuck is happening?

1080
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:05,596
Hold on!

1081
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:12,830
Where are the nukes?
In the stern.

1082
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:16,990
Hey, you were dead!

1083
01:25:17,116 --> 01:25:19,389
- The hell's going on?
- I'm a little busy.

1084
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:49,022
So what's the story?

1085
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,069
Twenty-five years ago,
we were doing a covert op,

1086
01:25:51,134 --> 01:25:52,893
and eight of my team
got wiped out.

1087
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,286
I had to fake my own death
to open up a classified file,

1088
01:25:56,414 --> 01:26:00,094
driving Marsh out of hiding
so I could prove he's Ocelot.

1089
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,790
Why'd you keep it from us?

1090
01:26:01,918 --> 01:26:03,758
If I didn't take that job,
they'd all be alive.

1091
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:06,173
So, it was personal.

1092
01:26:06,846 --> 01:26:08,701
You understand.

1093
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:41,062
Whew.

1094
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:43,165
I need a drink.

1095
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:44,869
Me too.

1096
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,902
- You're buying.
- I'm broke.

1097
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:50,686
You were funnier when you were dead.

1098
01:26:52,861 --> 01:26:55,133
Great spending time
with you again.

1099
01:26:55,262 --> 01:26:57,022
But you could use a shower.

1100
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:12,838
Toll Road,
you owe me 20 bucks.

1101
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:14,181
Guess you won't
be needing glasses.

1102
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:15,422
Not bad.

1103
01:27:15,549 --> 01:27:16,606
Hey.

1104
01:27:16,734 --> 01:27:21,086
Salute to my friends
who never quit.

1105
01:27:21,213 --> 01:27:22,525
Cheers to you all.

1106
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:23,485
<font color="#32D838"><i>Salud.</i></font>
Salute.

1107
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,438
To you guys.

1108
01:27:25,566 --> 01:27:27,878
What about that
corny quote on the ship, Christmas?

1109
01:27:27,902 --> 01:27:31,838
- You don't need to repeat that, Toll Road.
- "Make my sacrifice count!"

1110
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,437
Yeah, fuck you.

1111
01:27:33,566 --> 01:27:35,166
Stop giving him
such a hard time.

1112
01:27:35,294 --> 01:27:36,894
I think it's sweet.

1113
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:38,750
Aw.
That's sweet.

1114
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,758
They're all just jealous because
you're the most handsome one.

1115
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:42,886
I know.

1116
01:27:42,974 --> 01:27:44,478
Ain't love beautiful?

1117
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:46,621
Hey, Toll Road.

1118
01:27:47,614 --> 01:27:48,797
Really?

1119
01:27:49,566 --> 01:27:50,750
Ah.

1120
01:27:50,878 --> 01:27:52,830
Barney Ross,
back from the dead.

1121
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:56,733
Only you could walk away from a blazing
inferno with not a scratch on you.

1122
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:59,709
You are like a mythical bird
raising up from the ashes.

1123
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:01,629
I don't know how you
do it. Just a moment.

1124
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:03,654
I am relaxed. I'm trying
to talk to my hero over here.

1125
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,445
Would you give me some space
please, Easy Day?

1126
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:08,126
Hey, lame brain,
you got a minute?

1127
01:28:08,253 --> 01:28:09,917
Of course.
A minor question.

1128
01:28:10,046 --> 01:28:11,229
Step right in.

1129
01:28:11,358 --> 01:28:13,438
- There it is. Piece of junk.
- Ah.

1130
01:28:13,566 --> 01:28:14,566
I missed this.

1131
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:16,254
Thanks, my friend.
Yeah.

1132
01:28:17,182 --> 01:28:19,806
I need to know.
Who the corpse is?

1133
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,085
Exactly.

1134
01:28:21,214 --> 01:28:23,998
You ever wonder what
happened to Jumbo Shrimp?

1137
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,934
You didn't.

1138
01:28:46,526 --> 01:28:48,478
Oh, yes, I did.
